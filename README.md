# Automatic Industrial Waste Sorting System

Waste management has become one of the most pressing environmental challenges in modern society. Improper waste segregation not only reduces recycling efficiency but also increases landfill volume and environmental pollution.

Manual sorting is labour-intensive, time-consuming, and exposes workers to potential health hazards.
To address these challenges, this project proposes the design and development of an Automatic Waste Sorting System capable of sorting mixed material waste efficiently using low-cost methods with minimal human intervention. The system combines dual proximity sensors, an electromagnet, a bidirectional brush mechanism, an agitator, an NIR sensor, and pneumatic actuation, all controlled via a Raspberry Pi to achieve efficient and accurate segregation.

By integrating mechanical, electronic, and sensor-based technologies, the system ensures that metallic materials are separated first, followed by the detection and removal of plastics, with paper collected at the final stage. 

This automated approach not only saves time and labour but also promotes sustainable waste management practices by enabling high-quality recycling at the source.
